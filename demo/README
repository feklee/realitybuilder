Notes
=====

* Centering of HTML content is done with the help of a table, since other
  solutions don't seem to work decently with older browsers such as IE6. The
  problem often is that when the window is too small, content is clipped from
  the top.

  When changing the implementation for centering, don't forget to check whether
  the content is still displayed correctly when the browser window is smaller
  than the content.

* The date-time in the admin controls is shown in the time zone of the
  system/browser.
