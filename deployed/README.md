Introduction
============

This directory contains a copy of the Reality Builder widget written in Python
for Google App Engine. On March 20 2017 CET, the source code of the currently
deployed version was obtained from:

<https://console.cloud.google.com/debug
?repo=appengine:%3Fservice%3Ddefault%26version%3D1-9-0&fp=%2Frealitybuilder.js
&dlv=3&project=realitybuilder-hrd&app=GAE:default@1-9-0>

The intention was to make it workable on the soon mandatory Python 2.7 runtime.
