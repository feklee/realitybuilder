Introduction
============

This directory contains documentation for developers of Reality Builder.

Less well-known file extensions used:

* xar: Xara Xtreme (or compatible)

* 3dm: Rhino 3D


Demo
====

To run the demo, proceed as follows:

1. Upload the Reality Builder to the Google App Engine or start it on the
  development server included with the App Engine Python SDK.

2. Initialize sample data. For instuctions read the documentation at the top
  of:

    /demo/source/scene/init.py

3. Visit the demo user and admin interfaces (URLs relative to document root):

    /demo
    /demo/admin

  In the admin interface you can change settings and manage state of blocks.

To make the demo work with Internet Explorer versions less than 9, FlashCanvas
Pro is required. For reasons of license, this library is not included in the
distribution of the Reality Builder. If desired, install it as follows:

1. Download FlashCanvas Pro 1.5 or compatible from: http://flashcanvas.net/

2. Place FlashCanvas Pro into:

    /proprietary/FlashCanvasPro

  The directory "proprietary" is for proprietary software components that
  should not be redistributed as part of the Reality Builder source code.


Enabling debug mode
===================

See the top of: main.py


Embedding the Reality Builder in a web page
===========================================

Minimalistic code to embed the Reality Builder:

  <script type="text/javascript" 
          src="http://example.com/realitybuilder.js"></script>

  <script type="text/javascript">
    realityBuilder.initialize({width:640, height:480})
  </script>

  <div id="RealityBuilder"></div>

See the demo for more information.

Notes:

* With debug mode enabled, the web page and the Reality Builder must be hosted
  on the same domain.

* The RealityBuilder is created using the Dojo Toolkit. Other versions of Dojo
  can be used on the same page, if precautions are taken:

  - Do not configure Dojo 1.6 using "data-dojo-config" parameters. Rationale:
    Version 1.6 takes this parameter from the first script tag in the page, and
    that may be the wrong one.

  - Dojo for the Reality Builder is loaded asynchronously, and in debug mode it
    is configured using "djConfig". When in debug mode and when using
    "djConfig" to configure another version of Dojo, proceed for example as
    follows:

    (i) Make a backup of "djConfig".

    (ii) Load Dojo non-asynchronously.

    (iii) Restore "djConfig".

* Don't clobber:

  - realityBuilder
  
  - realityBuilderDojo, realityBuilderDojox, realityBuilderDijit
  
  - acme: due to a bug in Dojo 1.6

  - djConfig: see above


Unit tests
==========

Run unit tests by visiting (relative to the root URL) with debug mode enabled:

  /javascript/realitybuilder/tests/runTests.html


About blocks
============

Blocks must have the following shape:

  Right prism with a convex outline.

Blocks are solid, i.e. they never overlap.



About the camera
================

The camera x-y position must be outside of the x-y area where blocks are to be
built, and it must look down onto the blocks. All blocks, thus, are in front to
the sensor.

This limitation on camera placement allows for simpler and speedier code.


Terminology
===========

* Types of blocks:

  - New block: The block that may be positioned by the user.

  - Construction block: A block permanently in the construction.

    Types of construction blocks:

    . Real block: Block that is actually built.

    . Deleted block: Block that was deleted.

    . Pending block: Block that is not yet made real.

    The new, user positionable block is not part of the construction.

  - Shadow obscuring block: Block that is used for graphically removing parts
    of the new block's shadow that are not actually visible.

* Specifiers for coordinates (see also "perspective.xar"):

  - The coordinate specifiers ending in "B", e.g. "xB", denote positions in the
    grid where blocks may be placed. The space comprised by those coordinates
    is called "block position space", or short: "block space"

    Units: none (multiples of distances between positions)

    Value: integer

  - The coordinate specifiers ending in "BXY", denote block positions in the
    block space x-y plane.

  - The coordinate specifiers ending in "V" denote coordinates in "view space",
    i.e. the space relative to the lens, approximated as a pinhole, of the
    camera:

      +---x
      |\
      | \
      |  z
      y

    Units: mm

    The origin of the view space is in the pinhole.

  - The coordinate specifiers ending in "VXZ" denote coordinates in the view
    space x-z-plane. Points in this plane get mapped onto the horizontal line
    in the middle of the sensor: y = 0 Points are describe using x, z
    coordinate tuples.

    Units: mm

  - The coordinate specifiers ending in "S" denote coordinates in "sensor
    space", i.e. coordinates of projected points. The origin of the sensor is
    in one of its corners.

    Units: px

  - The coordinate specifiers ending in "VXZS" denote coordinates in the
    horizontal line in sensor space that the view space x-z-plane is mapped to.

    Units: px

  - All other coordinates are in world space.

    Units: mm

    To get from block space to world space, multiply block space coordinates by
    factors in mm. The multiplication factors for "xB" and "yB" are identical.
    Otherwise a block that is rotated in a plane would deform. The
    multiplication factor for "zB", however, is independent. Example:

    . Multiplication factor x, y: 5mm

    . Multiplication factor z: 3mm

* Point: Is specified as an array with two or three numbers: the coordinates.
  It is regarded as a vector, with its origin in the origin of the coordinate
  system.

* Edge: Connects two vertices. Is specified as an array with two indices to a
  vertex array, and a third index whose value is the original index/name of the
  edge. The third value is important to identify edges in case they are
  reordered.

* Line: straight line with infinite extends. Is specified as an array with two
  points that lie on it. If the points coincide, then the result of any
  function making use of the line is undefined.

* Line segment: similar to a line but with finite extends, connecting the
  points by which it is defined.

* Block: A block is described by an outline in the xy plane, in block space.
  Its height in block space is always: 1


Collision detection
===================

All configurations when two blocks collide can be configured freely. This is
done in block space.

At first it seems as if collision detection is better done in world space, and
automatically, without any configuration. However, when blocks touch each
other, then rounding errors can lead to unwanted results. Furthermore,
collision detection, as described above, in block space is probably simpler and
faster.


JSLint
======

Every Reality Builder JavaScript file contains configuration instructions at
the top for JSLint.


Releases
========

Before releasing a new version:

* Make sure that there no FIXME tagged comments in the code. Instead, if
  necessary, corresponding issues should be created in the issue tracker.

* Test with common browsers.

* Check that unit tests work.

* Disable debug mode.

* Check that the Reality Builder works fine with the sample data (/admin/init).



Versioning
==========

The version of a release is strucutred as follows:

  major.minor.bugfix

Example:

  2.1.4

Where:

* major (major release number): A major release is a release where the major
  release number has been increased. When that happens, then the minor release
  number and the bugfix release number are set to 0. The major release number
  is increased when - subjectively - there have been major changes as compared
  to the previous minor release.

* minor (minor release number): A minor release is a release where the minor
  release number has been increased. When that happens, then the bugfix release
  number is set to 0. The minor release number is increased when the changes as
  compared to the previous minor release are not major and not a bugfix.

* bugfix (bugfix release number): A bugfix release is a release where the
  bugfix release number has been increased. The bugfix release number is
  increased when a bug has been fixed in an already released version. In
  general, new features are only introduced with new minor or major releases,
  unless when absolutely necessary, and then these features are viewed as bugs.


Miscellaneous
=============

* In the datastore, blocks are allowed to occupy the same position, given that
  they have different rotation. This is enforced by giving the keys of the
  blocks the format: x, y, z, a. An example block outline that, when rotated
  about its center (by 180Â°) does not collide with the unrotated block:

    .
    |\
    | \
    +--+

* Canvas seems to have automatic "double buffering", i.e. Gecko and WebKit
  browsers don't draw to screen while executing code.

  According to a mailing list post by Robert O'Callahan <robert@ocallahan.org>:

    I assume you have a setTimeout handler (or similar) which renders a
    complete frame before returning. If so, then in Gecko and I think also in
    Webkit the canvas will not be drawn to the screen while your script is
    running, only between frames. So I suspect your performance problem has
    some other cause.

* The server directory "/javascript" is in part based on a so called custom
  Dojo build. One reason for using a custom build are limitations on the number
  and size of files on Google App Engine, as of April 2010.
  
  How to create the build:

  a) Check that the copyright notice is still correct:

    /javascript/realitybuilder.copyright

  b) Run the following command in the Dojo source distribution's "buildscripts"
    directory, from the Windows XP command line:

    > SET SCOPE_MAP=[
    > SET SCOPE_MAP=%SCOPE_MAP%[\"dojo\",\"realityBuilderDojo\"],
    > SET SCOPE_MAP=%SCOPE_MAP%[\"dijit\",\"realityBuilderDijit\"],
    > SET SCOPE_MAP=%SCOPE_MAP%[\"dojox\",\"realityBuilderDojox\"]]
    > build.bat profileFile=../../../realityBuilder.profile.js action=release ^
      scopeDjConfig=\{locale:\"en\",parseOnLoad:true\} ^
      localeList=en loader=xdomain xdDojoScopeName=realityBuilderDojo ^
      optimize=shrinksafe scopeMap=%SCOPE_MAP%
    > DEL /S /Q ..\..\..\dojo
    > COPY ..\..\release\dojo\dojo\dojo.xd.js* ..\..\..\dojo
    > XCOPY /E /I ..\..\release\dojo\dojo\_firebug ..\..\..\dojo\_firebug
    > XCOPY /E /I ..\..\release\dojo\dojo\nls ..\..\..\dojo\nls

    Note(s):

    . Specification of "scopeDjConfig" causes the global "djConfig" to be
      without effect, and therefore without conflict if existent.

    . The locale is "en" to keep things simple. Also then it seems that with
      "en" no Dojo NLS bundle gets loaded.

    . dojo.xd.js: The so called Dojo layer, also containing the Reality
      Builder code. The script file is cross domain compatible, i.e. it can be
      hosted on another domain than that of the page loading it.

    . _firebug: needed for Dojo debug mode

    . nls: needed for at least "dojox.date.posix.strftime"

* Certain RPC calls require admin priveledges, namely those that are available
  only via the admin interface. This is necessary so that users cannot hack
  into the system and, for example, delete blocks.

* The maximum buildling height makes it possible to always have a place to
  position the new block, even when there is little space left in the
  construction.

* States of blocks:

  - virtual: the new block which may be moved around has this state

  - pending: a block that has been requested to be build

  - real: a block that has been built

  - deleted: a block that has been removed or that is not planned to be build.

* Polar coordinates are described by an array with two entries:

  0 - angle: Angle measured counter clockwise against the positive x axis. Its
    value is between -PI and PI.

    |   /
    |  /
    | /\
    |/  |angle
    +------

  1 - distance: Distance from the origin.

* After a block has been built in place of a request, the formerly used new
  block becomes a movable/virtual new block again. In other words: Through an
  entire session, there is only one new block object which changes state, from
  from virtual to pending to virtual and so on.
